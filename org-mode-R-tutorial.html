<p>
This is an introduction to using R (<a href="http://www.R-project.org">http://www.R-project.org</a>) source
code within Emacs Org-mode (<a href="http://orgmode.org">http://orgmode.org</a>). Org-mode files use
headlines to organize information. Each top-level headline in this
document starts with a single '*', like the "Introduction" headline
below. While this is not an introduction to using Org-mode, you will
need to know one command to proceed: use the <code>TAB</code> key on a headline
to open it. <code>TAB</code> will cycle through the possible visibility states of
the information under the headline, and eventually <code>TAB</code> will collapse
the headline back to how you see it now. One last command to note:
<code>C-c C-o</code> opens links like those above in your web browser.
</p>

<p>
If you are following along in Org-mode, instead of reading this in an
exported format like HTML or PDF, you will need Org-mode 7.9.3e or
greater to go interact with this tutorial. See <a href="http://orgmode.org/index.html#sec-3">here</a> for instructions
on how to download the latest version of Org-mode. To see what version
of Org-mode you have installed, type <code>M-x org-version</code>, and hit
<code>&lt;ENTER&gt;</code>. The result will be in the minibuffer. If the version is
anything less than 7.9.3, you'll need to update to run the
examples. If you have an older version of Org-mode but just want to
read about the possibilities, you can continue on.
</p>

<h2 id="sec-1">Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Emacs Org-mode has an exciting feature that lets you submit source
code blocks within an Org-mode document for evaluation. This lets you
do things like insert the results of R code into an Emacs buffer,
insert graphical and tabular material into a buffer, or pass the
results of R code to other programming languages such as Python. R
code and results can be included in your exported Org-mode documents,
opening up several interesting possibilities for automatically
generating comprehensive documentation and advanced reports. You can
also extract the source code portions of an Org-mode document for
further processing through a process called <i>tangling</i>. This tutorial
will get you started using these Org-mode features together with the R
programming language.
</p>

<p>
If you are unfamiliar with Org-mode itself, you can learn a lot more
from the project's <a href="http://orgmode.org">website</a>. There are many good tutorials available on
Org-mode already. The <a href="http://orgmode.org/guide/index.html">compact guide</a> is a great place to start. This
current document focuses on source code support. Note that while the
features being demonstrated in this document were being developed, the
project was known as org-babel. Thus, many of the variables and
function names reference 'org-babel' in their names. Org-babel is now
distributed with Org-mode, so many of the previous configuration
hurdles are now avoided. Keep this in mind as you read old mailing
list posts and documentation. The authors of org-babel are Eric
Schulte and Dan Davison. They have worked very hard creating this
amazing system!
</p>

<p>
Although you may be viewing this tutorial in an exported format like
HTML or PDF, the tutorial was written in Org-mode. You will benefit
most from it by following along in Org-mode. Only then can you
interactively evaluate the examples to see Org-mode in action. For
this reason, you should download the actual org mode file that this
document is based on, visit the file in Emacs, and follow along there.
</p>

<p>
For those following along in an exported version, such as HTML, in the
actual Org-mode file, source code blocks look like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
#+BEGIN_SRC R 
  # some R code 
  square &lt;- function(x) 
  {
    x * x
  }
    
  square(1:10)
#+END_SRC
</pre>

<p>
However, when they are <i>exported</i> into documents like this they will
look like:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">  <span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">some R code </span>
  <span style="color: #0000ff;">square</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">&lt;-</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">function</span>(x) 
  {
    x * x
  }
    
  square(1:10)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
It's something to be aware of when following along from an exported
version such as HTML, since we will be referencing source code block
arguments that you will not be able to see.  That is another very good
reason to follow along with the raw org mode file.
</p>

<p>
This tutorial was written in GNU Emacs 24.3.50.1 (i686-pc-linux-gnu,
GTK+ Version 3.6.0) of 2013-01-28 on actinium, modified by Debian, on
Ubuntu 12.10, Org-mode version 7.9.3e (7.9.3e-1175-g3e95e8), pulled
directly from the Org-mode git repository.

First, we need to make sure our environment is setup correctly for the
examples to run.  This requires a bit more work under Windows than
others; see below.
</p>

<p>
Here is a list of software we need to run the examples:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Org-mode 7.9.3e or greater, see <a href="http://orgmode.org">http://orgmode.org</a>.
</li>
<li>A working R installation, see <a href="http://www.R-project.org">http://www.R-project.org</a>.
</li>
<li>The R examples use the <code>ggplot2</code> and <code>Hmisc</code> packages from
CRAN. Simply install from the R command line by issuing the
command <code>&gt; install.packages(c("ggplot2", "Hmisc"))</code>. R must be in
your <code>PATH</code> environment variable.  For Windows users, you will
probably have to add this yourself.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
For LaTeX support, 
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>a working LaTeX installation, see <a href="http://latex-project.org">http://latex-project.org</a>. Windows
users can use <a href="http://miktex.org/">MikTeX</a>.
</li>
<li><code>dvipng</code> program (comes with MikTeX or the <code>texlive-full</code> Ubuntu
package)
</li>
<li>Some extra LaTeX packages (comes with the <code>texlive-full</code> Ubuntu
package). On an Ubuntu 12.10 installation you may need to install
the <code>texlive-latex-extra</code> and <code>texlive-fonts-recommended</code> packages
to get the LaTeX documents that Org-mode produces to compile. You
can get both of these (plus <code>dvipng</code>) through the Ubuntu package
<code>texlive-full</code>, so simply installing the <code>texlive-full</code> package may
be the easiest option if you happen to be on Ubuntu.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
For Windows users who have installed MikTeX, you will need the to use
the MikTeX package manager to install the following packages for LaTeX
support to work by default: <code>soul</code>, <code>marvosysm</code>, <code>wasysym</code>, <code>wasy</code>,
<code>zhmetrics</code>. Install these and you should be good to go. Once you are
more accustomed to Org-mode you can customize your installation to not
require these additional LaTeX packages, but if you are reading this
tutorial then likely you are not yet advanced enough to make those
customizations, so just install them and it will work without further
changes.
</p>

<p>
For inline image support, you will need <code>libpng</code>, which GNU/Linux
users probably already have.  Windows you can download
<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gnuwin32/libpng-1.2.37-setup.exe">http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gnuwin32/libpng-1.2.37-setup.exe</a> and
after running the installation program, <b>manually</b> copy the
<code>libpng12.dll</code> and <code>zlib1.dll</code> files into your <code>emacs-24.x\bin</code>
directory, and then restart Emacs for inline image support to
work. One easy way to test if png support is working is to simply open
a png file within Emacs from dired.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Setting up Org-mode for source code evaluation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Setting up Org-mode to run source code is very simple. Since you are
reading the R tutorial, we will assume you want to specifically run R
source code blocks within Org-mode. Since we use LaTeX later on in the
tutorial, we'll also take the opportunity to set up Org-mode to
evaluate LaTeX blocks.
</p>

<p>
The absolute, bare minimum setup you need to perform is to run the
following Emacs lisp code. For a preview of what we're going to learn
with in this tutorial, simply hit <code>C-c C-c</code> anywhere in the following
code block. You will be asked in the minibuffer to confirm that you
want to evaluate the source code contained in the block. Confirm this,
and you'll be set up for the rest of the tutorial. You can also add
the lines between the <code>#+BEGIN_SRC</code> and <code>#+END_SRC</code> lines to your
Emacs initialization file, so that they are always run when starting
Emacs.
</p>

<p>
So go ahead, hit <code>C-c C-c</code> with point in the following code block.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((R . t)
     (latex . t)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you received any type of error message, please make sure that you
have the proper version of Org-mode installed by typing <code>M-x
org-version &lt;Enter&gt;</code>. You should have at least 7.01. If you still are
running Org-mode version 6.xx or before, please visit the project web
site for instructions on downloading the latest version.
</p>

<p>
If you didn't get any errors, Org-mode is now setup to run the R
examples that follow.
</p>

<p>
Note to Windows users: make sure the directory containing the R
executable is added to your <code>PATH</code> variable for you to run these
examples.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">Prompting for confirmation before evaluating code</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
There is one more variable to set in your Emacs initialization file
relating to evaluating source code in Org-mode. By default, Org-mode
will ask you to confirm each and every time you evaluate a source code
block. If you ran the above source code block with <code>C-c C-c</code>, you will
have noticed that behavior. You can turn this feature off with the
following line. If you choose, simply hit <code>C-c C-c</code> to evaluate it for
this session, or put it in your Emacs initialization file. Then, you
won't be asked before Org-mode evaluates source code blocks. You may
view this as a security risk. Always look over the code you're going
to evaluate before submitting it.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

Besides R, which we just set up with the above source code block, see
<a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Languages.html#Languages">here</a> for a list of languages that Org-mode currently supports. You can
then add more languages to your personal setup if you desire, by
modifying the variable we defined above to include more languages.

<h3 id="sec-3-1">Exporting pretty-printed source code blocks</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
Before we see how to evaluate code in Org-mode, let's start off with
looking at a what a typical Org-mode code block looks like. We just
saw a couple examples above of Emacs lisp source code blocks. In what
follows, we will be working with very simple R functions to show off
the capabilities of Org-mode.
</p>

<p>
The following is a simple R code block in Org-mode. You can edit the
code in its own buffer by typing C-c ' (that's a single quote), or
just by editing the code within the Org-mode buffer. The nice thing
about opening the code in its own buffer with C-c ' is that the
buffer is then in ESS mode. All the ESS key bindings, interaction with
the inferior R process, and syntax highlighting work as expected.
</p>

<p>
So here is an example of a source code block. The defining feature is
the <code>#+BEGIN_SRC</code> and <code>#+END_SRC</code> lines, with the language definition,
<code>R</code>, on the first line.
</p>

<p>
Try opening this code block by putting point anywhere inside of it,
and hitting C-c ' (that's a single quote). This will open a new
buffer, with the contents of the source code block. You can then edit
this buffer just like any other R file, as it is in R-mode from
ESS. When finished editing, hit C-c ' again, and you'll see any
changes you made reflected in this Org-mode buffer. You can control
how this new buffer is displayed by setting the <code>org-src-window-setup</code>
variable in Emacs.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R"><span style="color: #0000ff;">square</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">&lt;-</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">function</span>(x) 
{
  x * x
}
  
square(1:10)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So now we have this code block defined. Why would we want to do
something like that with Org-mode? Mostly so that when we export an
Org-mode document to a more human-readable format, Org-mode recognizes
those lines as syntax, and highlights them appropriately in the HTML
or LaTeX output. The lines will be syntax highlighted just like they
would be in an R code buffer in Emacs.
</p>

<p>
Try this for yourself. With point anywhere in this subtree, for
example, put it here [ ], hit <code>C-x n s</code> (that's a shortcut for
<code>org-narrow-to-subtree</code>), finally hit <code>C-c C-e h o</code>. This subtree
should be exported to an HTML file and displayed in your web
browser. Notice how the source code is syntax highlighted.
</p>

<p>
Note: for syntax highlighting in exported HTML to work, <code>htmlize.el</code>
must be in your <code>load-path</code>. The easiest way to make that happen if
you haven't already is to run the following Emacs lisp code, <b>after</b>
changing the <code>/path/to</code> portion to reflect your local setup. The
following can go in your Emacs init file.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"> (add-to-list 'load-path <span style="color: #8b2252;">"/path/to/org-mode/contrib/lisp"</span>)
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2">Evaluating the code block using Org-mode</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
As mentioned, defining the above code block would be useful if we
wanted to export the Org-mode document and have the R code in the
resulting, say, HTML file, syntax highlighted. The feature that
Org-mode now adds in version 7.01 is letting us actually submit the
code block to R to compute results for either display or further
computation.
</p>

<p>
It is worth pointing out here that Org-mode works with many languages,
and they can all be intertwined in a single Org-mode document. So you
might get results from submitting an R function, and then pass those
results to a Python or shell script through an org-table. Org-mode
then becomes a meta-programming tool. We only concentrate on R code
here, however.
</p>

<p>
We did see above in the setup section that we have Emacs lisp code in
this same Org-mode file. To be clear, you can mix many languages in
the same file, which can be very useful when writing documentation,
for instance.
</p>

<p>
Next, let's actually submit some R code.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-2-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-3-2-1">Obtaining the return value of an R code block</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-2-1">
<p>
We will now see how to submit a code block. Just as in the
Introduction with Emacs lisp code, simply hit <code>C-c C-c</code> anywhere in
the code block to submit it to R. If you didn't set the confirmation
variable to <code>nil</code> as described above, you'll have to confirm that you
want to evaluate the following R code. So go ahead, evaluate the
following R code block with <code>C-c C-c</code> and see what happens.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">  <span style="color: #0000ff;">square</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">&lt;-</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">function</span>(x) {
    x * x
  }
  
  square(1:10)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you've submitted the code block using <code>C-c C-c</code>, and everything
went well, you should have noticed that your buffer was
modified. Org-mode has inserted a results section underneath the code
block, and above this text. These results are from running the R code
block, and recording the last value. This is just like how R returns
the last value of a function as its return value. Notice how the
results have been inserted as an org-table. This can be very
useful. However, what if we wanted to see the standard R output? You
will see how to do that in the next section.
</p>

<p>
You can also try changing the source code block, and re-running
it. For example, try changing the call to the <code>square</code> function to
<code>1:12</code>, then hit <code>C-c C-c</code> again. The results have updated to the new
value!

<h4 id="sec-3-2-2">Obtaining all code block output</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-2-2">
<p>
We just saw how the last value after evaluating our code is put into
an Org-mode table by default. That is potentially very useful, but
what if we just want to see the R output as it would appear printed in
the R console? Well, just as R function have arguments, Org-mode
source blocks have arguments. One of the arguments controls how the
output is displayed, the <code>:results</code> argument. It is set to <code>value</code> by
default, but we can change it to <code>output</code> to see the usual R
output. Notice the syntax for setting source code block arguments
below.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">  <span style="color: #0000ff;">square</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">&lt;-</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">function</span>(x) {
    x * x
  }

  square(1:10)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
[1]   1   4   9  16  25  36  49  64  81 100
</pre>


<p>
Now we see the typical R notation for printing a vector. Note in the
following example that setting <code>:results output</code> captures <b>all</b>
function output, not just the return value. We capture things printed
to the screen with the <code>cat</code> function for example, or the printing of
the variable <code>x</code>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">  x <span style="color: #008b8b;">&lt;-</span> 1:10
  x
  <span style="color: #0000ff;">square</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">&lt;-</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">function</span>(x) {
    cat(<span style="color: #8b2252;">"This is the square function.\n"</span>)
    x * x
  }
  
  square(1:10)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
This is the square function.
 [1]   1   4   9  16  25  36  49  64  81 100
</pre>

<p>
Try changing the <code>:results</code> argument to <code>value</code> (which is the same as
omitting it completely), and re-run the above code block. You should
see the same org-table output as we saw above.

One of the biggest limitations to using code blocks like above is that
a new R session is started up "behind the scenes" when we evaluate
each code block. So, if we define a function in one code block, and
want to use it another code block later on, we are out of luck. This
limitation can be overcome by using R session-based evaluation, which
sends the R code to a running ESS process.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
Often in R, we will define functions or objects in one code block and
want to use these objects in subsequent code blocks. However, each
time we submit a code block using <code>C-c C-c</code>, Org-mode is firing up an
R session, submitting the code, obtaining the return values, and
closing down R. So, by default, our R objects aren't persistent!
That's an important point. Fortunately, there is an easy way to tell
Org-mode to submit our code blocks to a running R process in Emacs,
just like we do with R files in ESS.
</p>

<p>
You simply use the <code>:session</code> argument to the Org-mode source block.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">  <span style="color: #0000ff;">square</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">&lt;-</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">function</span>(x) {
    x * x
  }
  x <span style="color: #008b8b;">&lt;-</span> 1:10
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So, the above code block defines our function (<code>square</code>) and object
(<code>x</code>). Now we want to apply call our <code>square</code> function with the <code>x</code>
object. Without <code>:session</code>, we could not do this.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">  square(x)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Running the above code block will result in an error, since a new R

same code block, but with the <code>:session</code> argument, as below.

<div class="org-src-container">

Even though this tutorial covers the R language, one of Org-mode's

using results from a program written in one language as input to a
program in another language.

<p>

<h2 id="sec-5">Inserting R graphical output</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Here is a really cool feature of evaluating source code in
Org-mode. We can insert images generated by R code blocks inline in
our Emacs buffer! To enable this functionality, we need to evaluate a
bit of Emacs lisp code. If this feature is something you want every
time you use Org-mode, consider placing the code in your Emacs
initialization file. Either way, evaluate it with <code>C-c C-c</code>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (add-hook 'org-babel-after-execute-hook 'org-display-inline-images)   
  (add-hook 'Org-mode-hook 'org-display-inline-images)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The following R code generates some graphical output. There are
several things to notice.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><code>:results output</code> is specified. This is because the figure is
generated using the <code>ggplot2</code> package in R, which is based on
something called 'grid' graphics. Grid graphics need to be
explicitly printed when called within a function for their output
to be displayed. See, for example, <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Why-do-lattice_002ftrellis-graphics-not-work_003f">R FAQ 7.22</a>. When <code>:results
   value</code> (the default) is active, Org-mode is generating an R
function wrapper. The upshot is: when generating grid-based
graphical output within Org-mode, you need to either use <code>:results
   output</code>, wrap the graphical function in a print call, or use the
<code>:session</code> argument. See this mailing list <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/emacs-orgmode@gnu.org/msg25944.html">post</a> for more
explanation if you'd like.
</li>

<li>We use a new source code block argument, <code>:file</code>. This argument
will capture graphical output from the source block and generate a
file with the given name. Then, the results section becomes an
Org-mode link to the newly created file. In the example below, the
file generated is called <code>diamonds.png</code>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Finally, if you have defined the Emacs lisp code for inline-image
support above, an overlay of the file will be inserted inline in the
actual Org-mode document! Run the following source code block to see
how it works.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">  <span style="color: #008b8b;">library</span>(ggplot2)
  data(diamonds)
  dsmall <span style="color: #008b8b;">&lt;-</span>diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 100), ] 
  qplot(carat, price, data = dsmall)
</pre>
</div>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="diamonds.png"  alt="diamonds.png"/></p>

This opens up many opportunities for doing interesting things with R

<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">Inserting LaTeX output</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
We have just seen how to include graphical output in our Org-mode
buffer. We can also do something similar with LaTeX output generated
by R. Of course, this requires at least a working LaTeX
installation. You will also need to install the dvipng program
(<code>dvipng</code> package in Ubuntu, for instance). See the System
Requirements section for other prerequisites.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6-1">A simple example</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">
<p>
Let's work on a very simple example, displaying a LaTeX description in
our Org-mode buffer, using the official LaTeX logo. We will use R to
generate the code that will display the official logo. There's
obviously no reason to do this except for demonstration purposes.
</p>

<p>
First we must define an R source block that generates some LaTeX code
that displays the logo. That's fairly straightforward. Notice we have
given the source code block a name, so that we can call it later. We
use the <code>#+NAME</code> syntax to do this. Note that you <b>don't</b> have to run
the following code block, it will be run automatically by the next
one.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R" id="R-latex">  <span style="color: #0000ff;">latexlogo</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">&lt;-</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">function</span>() {
      <span style="color: #8b2252;">"\\LaTeX"</span>
  }
  
  latexlogo()
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Next, we define a new source block using the <code>latex</code> language, instead
of <code>R</code>, as we have been using. If we use a <code>:file</code> argument with a
LaTeX source code block, Org-mode will generate a file of the
resulting DVI file that LaTeX produces, and display it. This is just
like generating graphical output from R using a <code>:file</code> argument, so
there is nothing new there.
</p>

<p>
However, note we have a new argument, <code>:noweb</code>. What does that mean?
In short, it let's us use syntax like <code>&lt;&lt;CodeBlock()&gt;&gt;</code> to insert the
results of running a code block named <code>CodeBlock</code> into another source
code block. So, in our example, we're running the <code>R-latex</code> code block
defined above, and inserting the results, which need to be valid LaTeX
code, into our <code>latex</code> code block. For this example, we of course
didn't need to write an R function to generate such simple LaTeX
output, but it can be much more complicated, as our next example
shows. In short, our R code block is helping to write the LaTeX code
block for us.
</p>

<p>
Noweb was not invented for Org-mode, it's been around for a while, and
is used in Sweave, for example. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noweb">its Wikipedia page</a>. The <code>:noweb</code>
argument is set to 'no' be default, because the <code>&lt;&lt;X&gt;&gt;</code> syntax is
actually valid in some languages that Org-mode supports.
</p>

<p>
Run the following code block. The <code>R-latex</code> R code block will be run, generating the string <code>\LaTeX</code>, which is then substituted into this LaTeX code block, and then turned into the LaTeX logo by the latex program. Don't worry about the complicated header arguments, those will be explained in more detail in the next section.

<h3 id="sec-6-2">A more complicated example, exporting LaTeX in buffer, to HTML, and to PDF</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-2">
<p>
Now let's try something a little more complex, using an R function
that generates a full LaTeX table. This particular example depends on
having the R package Hmisc installed. If you don't have it installed,
start up R and then do: <code>&gt; install.packages("Hmisc")</code>.
</p>

<p>
What follows is an R source block that generates some LaTeX code
representing a table.  We want to be able to insert a <code>png</code> image of
the table in the buffer when run with <code>C-c C-c</code>, using the colors of
our current Emacs buffer.
</p>

<p>
A few sections from now, we'll touch on the exporting features of
Org-mode.  Org can generate HTML and PDF versions of documents like
this one.
</p>

<p>
Back to our example, for HTML export, we also want to generate a
<code>png</code>. However, we want the background to be transparent, not whatever
color our Emacs buffer happened to be.
</p>

<p>
For LaTeX output, we don't need a <code>png</code> file at all, we would of
course prefer to simply insert the auto-generated LaTeX code in the
exported LaTeX document, and then compile to PDF.
</p>

<p>
The following should accomplish all three goals.  
</p>

<p>
We tell the R code block to output LaTeX code using the syntax
<code>:results output latex</code>.  Also, only export the results.  If we export
both, then the LaTeX results would get exported twice when we export
to PDF, once from each code block.  It would actually be exported
twice when we export to HTML, but in that case, since the results are
wrapped in <code>#+BEGIN_LATEX/#+END_LATEX</code> lines, and are therefore not
included in the HTML export.
</p>

<p>
In the LaTeX code block, a file will be generated for in-buffer
evaluation and HTML export, but we don't want it produced for LaTeX
export, otherwise the image <i>and</i> the actual table will be included in
the PDF.

<p>
Combining the techniques shown above: submitting code blocks,
capturing output for further manipulation, and inserting graphical and
tabular material, we essentially have a basic notebook-style interface
for R.
</p>

<p>
This is potentially useful for countless tasks such as: a laboratory
notebook, time series analysis of diet/exercise habits, tracking your
favorite baseball team over the course of a season, or any reporting
task you can imagine. Since Org-mode is a general-purpose authoring
tool, with very strong exporting capabilities, almost anything is
possible.
</p>

<p>
For instance, some people use Org-mode to generate HTML for blogs that
they run. Several posters to the Org-mode mailing list have mentioned
writing their entire graduate theses in Org-mode, and even books.
</p>

<p>
This workflow serves as an alternative to the excellent <a href="http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/">Sweave</a> package
that cuts out the need for learning LaTeX to produce high-quality
documents. Org-mode is doing all the exporting for you, including
LaTeX if you'd like. Getting LaTeX and HTML output essentially "for
free" should not be underestimated!
</p>

<p>
On some level, all these activities assume that you are a comfortable
Org-mode user, and that you will be writing code, conducting analyses,
and possibly exporting results through the familiar Emacs and Org-mode
user interface. Through the exporting functionality, Org-mode offers
many useful and easy-to-use options to share <i>results</i> of your efforts
with others, but what about the code itself?
</p>

<p>
Most people you have to share code with aren't going to want an
Org-mode file full of source code!

<div id="outline-container-sec-8" class="outline-2">

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
With many projects, you will have to share <i>code</i> with other
programmers who are most likely not going to be programming in
Org-mode. Therefore, sharing an Org-mode file full of code is not an
option.
</p>

<p>
Or, consider development of an R package. The package building process
obviously operates on <code>.R</code> files, each full of R functions. However,
that's not what we have in a document like this one.
</p>

<p>
It is in situations like these where <i>tangling</i> can be used. 
</p>

<p>
The process of tangling an Org-mode document essentially extracts the
code contained in Org-mode source code blocks, and places it in a file
of the appropriate type. How do we do this? We use the <code>:tangle</code>
source code block header argument to direct Org-mode what to do. Then,
we call the tangle function on the file to extract the source code!
</p>

<p>
Read on to learn how to perform each of these steps.

<p>
Let's take a look at a few examples. Each example contains an R
comment so that you can see in the resulting <code>.R</code> file where it came
from.
</p>

<p>
This first example will not extract any code from the source block. It
is the default behavior.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R"><span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">tangle was not specified</span>
x <span style="color: #008b8b;">&lt;-</span> 1:10
print(x)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The following will place the code in source code block in
<code>org-mode-R-tutorial.R</code> since we don't specify a filename for the
<code>.R</code> file.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R"><span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">tangle was specified, but no file given</span>
x <span style="color: #008b8b;">&lt;-</span> 1:10
print(x)
</pre>

<p>
The following will place the tangled code in <code>Rcode.R</code>, since we
specify that name.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R"><span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">tangle was specified, and a file name given (Rcode.R)</span>
x <span style="color: #008b8b;">&lt;-</span> 1:10
print(x)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note that we will have multiple source code blocks in an Org-mode
file, and they might have different types. For example, we might have
R and Python code in the same document, but different source blocks.
</p>

<p>
This is no problem as the tangling mechanism will generate appropriate
files of each type containing only the code of that type.
</p>

<p>
Finally, you can specify the <code>:tangle</code> argument as a buffer-wide
setting, so that you don't have to specify it for every source code
block.
</p>

<p>
This opens up exciting possibilities like having a <b>single</b> Org-mode
file that includes:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>all code for an R package

<li>all documentation for the package

<p>
We simply have to call the <code>org-babel-tangle</code> function, bound by
default to <code>C-c C-v t</code>.
</p>

<p>
Org-mode confirms in the minibuffer how many code blocks have been
tangled, and inspecting the file system should show that your source
code files have been created. There exists a hook function that will
run any post-processing programs you have defined, for example, a
compiler, <code>R CMD build</code>, or running <code>make</code> with a Makefile, possibly
itself generated from the Org-mode document!

Org-mode provides a rich set of functions and customizations for
exporting documents into more human-readable forms, and for users who
are not Emacs or Org-mode users. The most common methods are
generating PDF documents through LaTeX, and HTML output. Source code
will be syntax highlighted in HTML.  There are various options for
PDF including using the <code>listings</code> package.
</p>

<p>
With Org-mode source blocks, you can choose to export the source code,
the results of evaluating the source code, neither, or both. The
<code>:exports</code> header argument controls this. See the <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting-code-blocks.html#Exporting-code-blocks">documentation</a> for
further examples.
</p>

<p>
As an example, type <code>C-c C-e h o</code> to see an HTML version of this

<p>
Some fairly sophisticated processes, including complete report
generation using R graphics and tables, can be achieved through this
facility.

Using Org-mode in this manner is essentially an alternative to Sweave,
with the advantages of:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>you do not need to learn LaTeX or other markup language

If you're an advanced LaTeX user, you probably don't view point 1

For an exercise in using Org-mode with source code, you can write your

out of date, but they give you a general idea of how to
proceed. Essentially, your master Emacs init file will simply tangle
an Org-mode file full Emacs lisp code blocks, and then load the
resulting file.
